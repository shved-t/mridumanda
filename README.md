## Attributions

Like the original version of mine, this version also uses the ASCII art for weather representation. These representations (ASCII arts) were created by [Julynx](https://github.com/Julynx). It was taken from [here](https://github.com/Julynx/wthr).

## 📍 Note

This project is a rewritten version of the original MriduManda, which was developed under another GitHub account of mine in [this](https://github.com/shvedt/mridu-manda.git) repo. That account is no longer accessible, and as a result, the project is being completely rebuilt here from scratch — keeping its original purpose, but with improved clarity, structure, and maintainability.
